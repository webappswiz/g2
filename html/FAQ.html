                <h3 class="rad-5">1. What exactly is Goodiebox?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>Goodiebox is a creative and unique service in Hungary, specially created for your puppy! If you wish to surprise your puppy, then you are in the right place.</p>
                  <p>At the moment, we have two types of boxes: Goodiebox Smart and Goodiebox Plus. The box content changes every month, this makes it worth buying every single month.</p>
                  <p>Your puppy has a birthday?</p>
                  <p>Order a super Goodiebox Plus, because for birthday puppies, we include a special item to mark this important ocassion!</p>
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3 class="rad-5">2. How can I order for my puppy?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>In the first step, you will be asked to give your puppy size and some other important details. For us to put the right items in your box, it's important that you give us the right information about your puppy. When you are done with the first step, click next to proceed to the second step.</p>
                  <p>In the second step, you can confirm that you have chosen the right box. If everything is okay, click next to proceed to the next step.</p>
                  <p>In the third step, you can give your billing and shipping information! Please be sure to check that the information you supply is accurate to prevent any delays in receiving your box!</p>
                  <p>You can complete your order by selecting the appropriate payment method, check the "Terms and Conditions" box and finally clicking the order button.</p>
                  <p>If you select the credit card payment method, you will be redirected to SIMPLE online payment page. Here you will be required to fill in your card details and then finish your order. We do not save your credit card information on our website. For this payment method, there are no hidden charges.</p>
                  <p>If you select cash on delivery payment method, your order will be completed immediately and this means you have agreed to make payment in cash when the package is delivered to you. In this case, we charge 800 Ft for handling fees.</p>
                  <p>When you complete your first order on our site, your profile is automatically created. For subsequent orders, you just need to login with your email address and password. You may then access your profile and update your delivery address or make new orders.</p>
                  <p>After you complete your order, you will receive two email messages. The first email provides information regarding your registration and how your can access your profile on our website. The second email is the order confirmation which contains your invoice and delivery information.</p>
                  <p>IMPORTANT! If you do not receive both messages within 24 hours after you complete your order, please send us a message at info@goodiebox.hu! Thank you!</p>

                <h3 class="rad-5">3. I have more than one dog. Can I order more than a box at once?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>Yes, you can order multiple boxes, but just one after the other. After your first order, you can login to your profile and create another profile for other puppies if you have more than one puppy. You may also choose to delete profiles you have created for your puppy and create new profiles too!</p>
                </div>

              <li>
                <h3 class="rad-5">4. How much and how can I pay?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>At the moment, we have two box types available:</p>
                  <h3>Goodiebox Smart 5990 Ft</h3>

                  <p>Every month, 4-6 unique premium quality products (food, treats, toys, accessories, vitamins, grooming items) are in the box.</p>
                  <p>These prices are fixed and there are no hidden charges because the packaging, handling and delivery are free (just if you pay with bank card). If you have a discount coupon code, of course you can use this during the order process.</p>
                  <h3>Payment Options:</h3>
                  <p>Instant bank card payment method (SIMPLE online payment system, this has no additional charges!)</p>

                <h3 class="rad-5">5. If I order now, when will I get the box?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>The webshop opens at the beginning of each month and is open for a few days. We continue to count down until the order period ends. While open, you can make as many orders as you want. When the ordering period ends, the "We're Closed" message is displayed on the home page and we can not accept further orders in this case until the next month. We then start to process your order, preparing a Goodiebox personalized package just for your puppy! Your package will be delivered in about 10 days, free of charge to your doorstep (There is an additional 800 forints charge for cash on delivery orders). We love to hear from you, so be sure to send us your feedback after you receive your package! Also follow us on Facebook and Instagram where we always post our opening times so you never miss out! If you wish to receive an automated message when our webshop opens, please subscribe on our home page. This subscription is only available when the shop is closed for orders.</p>

                <div>
                  <p>It's very important that you provide us with accurate delivery information to prevent any delays in receving your Goodiebox. Also important is the email address you supply when making your first order - that's because all order and delivery notifications will be sent to this email address. Your Goodiebox will arrive at your doorstep 10-15 days after our order period closes. Remember that delivery is free if you paid with your bank card!</p>

                <h3 class="rad-5">7. Can I somehow know what will be in the next box? Can I choose?</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>Goodiebox is a super secret surprise box kept closely to us, we only decide what will be in the box every month. We're creative, we love teamwork - this guarantees that every box you receive will consistently bring you and your puppy pleasant surprises :-)	</p>
                  <p>Don't worry, we're always tracking items you have received - this makes it impossible for you to receive the same combination of items within a 1 year period.	</p>
